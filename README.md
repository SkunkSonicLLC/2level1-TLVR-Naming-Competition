2level1 Projects - Naming Competition for Tape Looper VR
Welcome to the Tape Looper VR Naming Challenge! 🎶🚀
Tape Looper VR has been an unnoticed yet powerful concept floating on the internet for over 8 years. Now, it’s time to give it a name that truly represents its innovation, purpose, and future impact.
How This Works:
We are opening up community-driven naming suggestions to find the best and most telling name for Tape Looper VR. This is a chance to define history and ensure that the concept is properly recognized and understood!
What is Tape Looper VR?
Tape Looper VR is a creative digital experience that blends:
	•	Immersive audio looping & layering mechanics
	•	VR/AR interaction to enhance real-time music creation
	•	Decentralized ownership & collaboration models
It represents a new paradigm in digital music experience—but its current name doesn’t fully capture its power. That’s where YOU come in.
